1. What is the general trend in the curve?
	The general trend is that as the percentage of data used for training
	increases, the accuracy on the test set increases linearlly (emphasis 
	on general trend).

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?
	Yes, some parts are noisier than others. This is because since the
	number of trials is so low, the chance that the few trials that were run
	were close to that the expected value should be is relatively low (meaning
	that there is a higher chance for error).

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
	At around 15 and above trials the amount of noise is relatively trivial,
	and at around 500 and above trials there is almost no noise and the curve
	is basically smooth. 

4. Try different values for C. What happens?
	If the power of C is a small negative number (-3 for example), then the 
	curve quickly approaches accuracy on test set = ~.95 and then stays 
	relatively constant. If the power of C is a large negative number (-20 
	for example), then the curve quickly approaches accuracy on test set = 
	~.10 and then stays relatively constant. If the power of C = ~ -10, then
	the accuracy on test set generally increases linearlly.
